** TODO Next 13
- From the beginning arquitecture what should be applied to improve the basic use case in guifi
- Next to be done: integration with guifi
*** TODO To be done [/]
- [ ] Basic use case defined (bidirectional videoconference)
- [ ] Use case requirements documented
- [ ] Definition, documentation and justification of the architecture (component selection, implementation, protocols, etc)
- [ ] Demo POC that shows that it works as supposed
- [ ] Requeriments to implement this in guifi (basic use case evolution)
- [ ] Impact of new requeriments to the defined architecture
- [ ] Proposal of architecture v2 (includes integration requirements)
** TODO Development [0/1]
*** TODO WebRTC POC (Proof of Concept) application that use jssip.net
- [ ] Understand how it works
- [ ] Modify appropiately to run in my own server
