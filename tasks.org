***** TODO Architecture and Deployment
** TODO Metaorganization
** TODO Theory
*** TODO Use cases and general documentation
- From the beginning arquitecture what should be applied to improve the basic use case in guifi
- Next to be done: integration with guifi
**** TODO To be done [6/7]
- [X] [[file:doc/user-cases.org::*basic%20use%20case%20defined][Basic use case defined]] (bidirectional videoconference)
- [X] [[file:doc/webrtc-architecture.org::*Use%20case%20requeriments][Use case requeriments]] documented
- [ ] Definition, documentation and justification of the architecture (component selection, implementation, protocols, etc)
- [X] Demo POC that shows that it works as supposed [Works with a local tryit.jssip.net and RetroRTC only with firefox]
- [X] Requeriments to implement this in guifi (basic use case evolution)
- [X] Impact of new requeriments to the defined architecture
- [X] Proposal of architecture v2 (includes integration requirements)
*** TODO About graphics
- [ ] Fix: Graph, MEDIA CTRL -> MC
- [ ] Do another graphs what happens from WebRTC to SIP
*** TODO Read [2/6]
- [ ] Evaluate security features: the use of DTLS-SRTP is secure (vs ZRTP): https://webrtchacks.com/webrtc-must-implement-dtls-srtp-but-must-not-implement-sdes
