- [X] "I wanted to do about VoIP (see next Chapter) but Miquel Oliver encouraged me to do about WebRTC, and he presented me Victor Pascual."
- [ ] Why is a disrupting technology WebRTC?
  - [ ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation#Disruptive_technology
  - [ ] http://searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com/tip/WebRTC-applications-could-disrupt-UC-market
  - [ ] Why is evolving WebRTC?
  - [ ] Why is changing the way ...?
- [ ] How WebRTC is changing everything
- [ ] Signalling JSON is the best option (webrtchacks.com) but others are more complex (Sip ws, XMPP ws), and work good. There is no problem at all with signal. I prefer signalling servers that were working for years, that a new signalling server with JSON (argument against simplewebrtc, json signalling server? not standard?)
- [ ] What is an ATA
- [ ] Explain at least one topic using math formulation
- [ ] About QoS, how is done by Angel Elena, what said velazquezPFC
- [ ] What appendices, and detail them in Last part of Chapter 1, introduction
- [ ] Better documentation of *Scrum*
- [ ] Brief mention to IP-ranges Subnetting
- [ ] Softphone
- [ ] Security compromised in VPN-tunnels, where the true IP address of the user can be read. (in webrtc state of the art)

  - https://torrentfreak.com/huge-security-flaw-leaks-vpn-users-real-ip-addresses-150130/
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC#Concerns
- [ ] [graphics] Do another graphs what happens from WebRTC to SIP
- [ ] From the beginning arquitecture what should be applied to improve the basic use case in guifi
**** Parts to Fill
- [ ] every chapter should introduce the subparts
- [ ] Chapter 1 Outline (1.3) has to be completed
- [ ] 4.4.1 scrum plan, little introduction
**** Questions
- [ ] What to use in the redaction of the memory: 1 or one, 2 or two?
- [ ] Gantt diagram is table or figure? 0> is a type of bar chart
- [ ] WebRTC codecs, is about video codecs, or also audio codecs?
**** Parts to Fix
- [ ] Fix: Graph, MEDIA CTRL -> MC
**** Bibliography
***** Book SIP that I'm missing...
***** RFC's Jaume?
** TODO Metaorganization
1 month, 4 iterations
*** Milestones
- Definitive title of TFG and abstract <2015-05-25 Mon>
- Deliver complete memory <2015-06-12 Fri>
** TODO Theory
*** TODO Use cases and general documentation
**** TODO To be done [6/7]
- [X] [[file:doc/user-cases.org::*basic%20use%20case%20defined][Basic use case defined]] (bidirectional videoconference)
- [X] [[file:doc/webrtc-architecture.org::*Use%20case%20requeriments][Use case requeriments]] documented
- [ ] Definition, documentation and justification of the architecture (component selection, implementation, protocols, etc)
- [X] Demo POC that shows that it works as supposed [Works with a local tryit.jssip.net and RetroRTC only with firefox]
- [X] Requeriments to implement this in guifi (basic use case evolution)
- [X] Impact of new requeriments to the defined architecture
- [X] Proposal of architecture v2 (includes integration requirements)
**** TODO Read [2/6]
- [ ] Evaluate security features: the use of DTLS-SRTP is secure (vs ZRTP): https://webrtchacks.com/webrtc-must-implement-dtls-srtp-but-must-not-implement-sdes
