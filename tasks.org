- From the beginning arquitecture what should be applied to improve the basic use case in guifi
- Next to be done: integration with guifi
*** TODO To be done [6/7]
- [X] [[file:doc/user-cases.org::*basic%20use%20case%20defined][Basic use case defined]] (bidirectional videoconference)
- [X] [[file:doc/webrtc-architecture.org::*Use%20case%20requeriments][Use case requeriments]] documented
- [ ] Definition, documentation and justification of the architecture (component selection, implementation, protocols, etc)
- [X] Demo POC that shows that it works as supposed [Works with a local tryit.jssip.net and RetroRTC only with firefox]
- [X] Requeriments to implement this in guifi (basic use case evolution)
- [X] Impact of new requeriments to the defined architecture
- [X] Proposal of architecture v2 (includes integration requirements)
** TODO Development [0/1]
*** TODO WebRTC POC (Proof of Concept) application that use jssip.net
- [ ] Understand how it works
- [ ] Modify appropiately to run in my own server
**** Option 1: RetroRTC
