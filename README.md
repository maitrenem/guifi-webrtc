## *Making-Of* Tour
- **diary.org**: record of activity in time
- **tasks.org**: parts to do for the project
- **doc directory**: independent parts written before starting the memory, or that needs isolation
  - **doc/index.org**: organise the different files of this directory
  - **doc/document-structure.org**: organise this different files for a thesis
- **latexbuild**: place where emacs orgmode memory file is exported to latex and compiled to PDF following university constraints
  - **thesis.org**: source code of memory
  - **thesis.pdf**: memory
- **img directory**: images needed for the thesis
 
What is **.org**? Is the file extension of [Emacs Orgmode](http://orgmode.org), a software to do all stuff: planning, brainstorming, export to PDF with latex constraints
