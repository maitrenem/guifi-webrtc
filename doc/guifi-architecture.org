* Guifi.net: architecture of the network
- *Government* is the guifi.net web application. Legal manager guifi.net Foundation
  - Open source project based on drupal v6
  - Manage IPv4 unique addresses
  - The best place to make something standard or easy to use. Example: unsolclic, easy configuration of devices
- *Social* architecture
  - *Community*: all the people that have access to the guifi.net network
  - *Zone*: geographic place where there are different *organizations*
    - *Volunteer*: no SLA (Service-Level Agreement)
    - *Association*: group of volunteers and professionals
    - *Freelance professional*: SLA
    - *Company*: group of professionals. SLA
- *Technical* architecture in a zone
  - /Mesh/ - modern routing protocols
    - *design*: each node extends the network
    - *firmware*: open source, based on OpenWrt project. Most used:
      qMp and libremesh.
    - *common internet sharing* through layer 3 tunnels or direct access
    - *routing*
      - bmx6 (qMp or libremesh): Works at layer 3. Autodiscover neighbors
      - batman-adv (libremesh): Works at layer 2 with linux kernel
        features. It is like a distributed switch, no problem with
        mobility
  - /Infrastructure/ - traditional routing protocols
    - *design*
      - supernode: extends the network, conform a backbone network
      - node or client node: connects to a supernode
    - *firmware*: factory, examples: ubiquiti, mikrotik.
    - *common internet sharing* through HTP proxy (specific ports), or layer 7 tunnels (OpenVPN)
    - *routing*
      - BGP, each supernode is an Autonomous System (AS)
      - BGP for messages that goes inside or outside the AS, OSPF inside the AS
** [draft] Requeriments
- Max delay: 100 ms. "Jitter buffers (used to compensate for varying delay) further add to the end-to-end delay, and are usually only effective on delay variations less than 100 ms. Jitter must therefore be minimized."

- Wifi link quality is not bidirectional, could be different quality in both directions
- Brandwidth requeriments: ?
- DNS requeriments: ?
** Good practices
- When there are two zones, with different routing protocols. It is preferable that a single router understand the two protocols because has the two routing tables and makes easy the communication. Experiences of two protocols, two different routers connected, gave problems.
** Questions
- Are the professional VoIP routers using QoS? (Angel Elena)
