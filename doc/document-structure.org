** Title (confirm)
A solution for Real Time Communications in Community Networks based on WebRTC
** TODO Abstract
** Document Structure (draft)
1. *Introduction*
   - *guifi.net architecture*
   - *Community wireless* (? not confirmed): bandwidth, delay and other parameters of wifi that affects RTC communications. Needs on connectivity
   - *User cases*: services that people need in community networks
2. *State of the art*: Other solutions proposed to solve the problem inside guifi.net and in the Internet
3. *Methodology*: WebRTC study
   - Study the feasability of WebRTC as a general solution to solve this user cases
     - Detailed description of WebRTC and deep study of its features
       - By default use open formats (vp8 / opera). Has compatibility with PSTN codec standard
       - WebRTC solves NAT traversal
     - Relation between WebRTC, signalling and RT multimedia protocols (SIP, RTP, H.323, ...)
     - Available implementations
4. *Results*: Deployment
   - if it is a good solution, design and implementation based on Guifi.net's architecture and users cases
