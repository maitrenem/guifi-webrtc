* [DRAFT] WebRTC arquitecture
** Signalling intro
http://www.kamailio.org/events/2014-KamailioWorld/day2/14-Anton.Roman.Portabales-WebRTC-Signaling.pdf
http://www.webrtc.org/architecture
** Arquitecture - Component selection, implementation, protocols
Component selection requirements: Open source software, patent free, open standards

*** basic use case defined
**** Core functions
- Auth system:
  - guifi.net LDAP
    - LDAP module kamailio http://kamailio.org/docs/modules/1.4.x/ldap.html#id2454070
    - guifi.net http://ca.wiki.guifi.net/wiki/LDAP/ca
  - auth ephemeral (for anonymous)
    - http://kamailio.org/docs/modules/devel/modules/auth_ephemeral.html
  - OAuth 2.0 ?
    - OAuth 2.0 has become a popular mechanism for user authentication and authorization on the web, with support for a variety of advanced web signaling flows. (security: https://webrtchacks.com/whats-in-a-webrtc-javascript-library/)
- Signalling Server: SIP Proxy, kamailio
- Media controller: STUN, TURN service, coturn
- Application: Web application nodejs
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/easyrtc ? https://webrtchacks.com/own-phoneco-with-webrtc/
- Communication protocol between:
  - user and server: Websockets (RFC7118 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7118)
  - users: WebRTC Datachannel
**** Social functions
- Two options
   - Use XMPP
   - Use SIP Presence
*** guifi.net integration (to review)
**** Core functions
1. Mount the server easily, integrating this architecture inside http://cloudy.community through an RTC plugin
2. SIP trunking between SIP proxies
3. JSSIP makes WebRTC compatible with SIP system. This library is done with the authors of RFC7118.
**** Helper functions
1. Improve dnsservices (bind syntax)
   - SRV: A Domain Name Server (DNS) SRV record for SIP does the same thing as a mail exchanger record for email.
   - development environment guifi drupal6 http://ca.wiki.guifi.net/wiki/Preparant_l'entorn_de_desenvolupament
2. ? Geolocalization: OSM with leaflet. Quality metric (?)
*** extension (not approved)
**** Core functions
1. WebRTC is able to share desktop
2. As it is text processing, it can be centralised to a server. It can be used XMPP (Prosody) as signalling because has the most advanced chat features. It means that *2 signalling protocols* run together, but is better than deploy gateways.
3. The web application should be able to integrate the chat in XMPP to a SIP call
**** Advanced functions
1. Media Controller SFU (mux/demux) from jitsi has high performance https://jitsi.org/Projects/JitsiVideobridgePerformance
   - Describes how it works. "Last N: relevance-based selectivity for forwarding video in multimedia conferences" http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2736094
2. Kurento Media Server has as Tutorial "WebRTC one-to-many" http://www.kurento.org/docs/current/tutorials.html#tutorial-3-webrtc-one-to-many-broadcast
   - alternative, licode? http://lynckia.com/licode
**** Social functions
1. ? Prosody file server
2. Web application with database to store information
3. XMPP funcionality XEP-0313 (Message Archive Management)
4. ? Ticketing system / bug report
**** Helper functions
1. Web application with database to store information, performs SIP functionality (?)
** comments
is not efficient to implement in one browser a lot of datachannels to other places
