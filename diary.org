- guifi.net proxies are problematic for webrtc applications, but as they use websockets (proof that), we can use websockets proxy. http://nginx.com/blog/realtime-applications-nginx/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket#Proxy_traversal

I started organizing contents of the past weeks that took me to this situation

**** WebRTC demo
Succeded in the most easy way to try WebRTC between two computers,
very interesting to do a demo

: sudo apt-get install apache2
: cd /var/www
: git clone https://github.com/peers/peerjs/
: cd peerjs
: mv examples/videochat/* .

change
: <script type="text/javascript" src="/dist/peer.js"></script>
to
: <script type="text/javascript" src="dist/peer.js"></script>

One browser:
: localhost/peerjs/index.html

Other browser:
: <ip>/peerjs.index.html

Update:
Signalling server in the internet
